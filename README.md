# Leaflet Challenge - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

This challenge used Leaflet and D3 to add geoJSON data regarding earthquakes onto a Mapbox map. The data was sourced from [USGS Earthquake Data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). This data contains all earthquake data from the last seven days. 

The visualization displays all the earthquakes and indicates the intensity of each earthquake by magnitude. A popup displays the location, magnitude, and time of the earthquake:

The color of the circle indicates the magnitude of the earthquake, as well as the size of the circle. The legend describes the magnitudes.
